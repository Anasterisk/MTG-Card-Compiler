# MTG-Card-Compiler
A Magic the Gathering Api that allows you compile your deck

#For this project, I will be assembling an Magic the Gathering Compiler using the "https://docs.magicthegathering.io/" API

#objective
I will be creating a search function that will pull cards according to their properties through the API as well as a filter function to show an array of cards that meet the required description. 

##Stretch objective
Cards with multiple variations will be displayed within it own detailed page once you select one of its various iterations.
Create an interactable card that allows you pick and adjust the traits of the templete card to search the api for cards that fit it's description. E.G the mana color and cost can be filtered in the top right side of the templete where the mana color and cost is normally found on the card.

##Layout
https://wireframe.cc/CMvi6O
The most general layout would most likely be this with the top left panel being the stretch goal layout.
